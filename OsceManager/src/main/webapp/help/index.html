    </div>
      <p><em>The OSCE Manager Manual</em> is a user guide for the <a href="http://www.osce-manager.com" title="OSCE Manager Website">OSCE Manager</a>. It mainly serves as a reference guide that should cover most of the questions that may arise in everyday use of the application. For a general overview and quick introduction to the <em>OSCE Manager</em> we advise you to have a look at the 12 minute <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_yJG9bPF_Q" title="OSCE Manager - An Introduction">introduction video</a>.</p>
      <p>Like the <em>OSCE Manager</em>, the manual is written and maintained by the <a href="http://medizin.unibas.ch">Medical Faculty Of The University of Basel</a> For any inquiries regarding this manual, please write an email to <script type="text/javascript">

      <h1><a href="#introduction-and-overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction and overview</a></h1>
      <p>As has been mentioned in the abstract, we suggest to have a look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_yJG9bPF_Q" title="OSCE Manager - An Introduction">introduction video</a>. It guides you through the process of organising an Objective Structured Clinical Examination step by step and thereby gives you an overview of all the modules of the <em>OSCE Manager</em> and how they roughly interact with each other. This video is the quickest way to delve into the matter.</p>
      <p>This first chapter of the manual will give you a more general overview about what the <em>OSCE Manager</em> consists of. First the rough architecture of the system the software runs on is explained without getting too technical. This may help you to better understand certain features of the software. Furthermore we will explain the basic user interface of the application as well as how the software is divided up in several modules and how they interact.</p>
      <div id="system-architecture" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#system-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> System Architecture</a></h2>
      <p>The <em>OSCE Manager</em> as a whole basically consists of two seperate applications, that would usually be running on different servers. The first is the <em>OSCE Manager</em> itself, while the second application is the <em>SP Portal</em>, which is intended to be accessible via the internet, so as to allow simulated patients to fill in their personal details or participate in surveys. In figure 1-1 you see this concept graphically illustrated.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/1-1-system_architecture.png" title="Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture" alt="1-1: Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture." /><p class="caption">1-1: Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The data synchronisation between the two applications is initiated manually by a user of the <em>OSCE Manager</em>. The <em>SP Portal</em> application only stores simulated patient data temporarily, for as long as it is required to be accessible by the SP. Typically both applications are installed on different web servers and therefore are accessed via different URLs, for example the <em>OSCE Manager</em> may be accessible through <em>https://osce-manager.private.myuniversity.edu</em> whereas the <em>SP Portal</em> could be reachable by e.g. entering <em>https://sp-portal.myuniversity.edu</em> in your web-browsers address bar.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Important</em>: Please be aware that the above URLs are only examples! Please ask your system administrator for the URLs that are used at your institution!</p>
      </blockquote>
      </div>
      <div id="main-application-layout" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#main-application-layout"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Main Application Layout</a></h2>
      <p>When you start the <em>OSCE Manager</em> you will be confronted with the SP management view. As soon as you click on an entry of the table you will see that the view is roughly divided into four segments. Illustrated in figure 1-2 is said perspective with the four segments, colored in red, green, blue and yellow for ease of explanation.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/1-2-ui.png" title="Overview of user interface" alt="1-2: The main user interface segments of the application, which are colored red, green, blue and yellow in this screen shot." /><p class="caption">1-2: The main user interface segments of the application, which are colored red, green, blue and yellow in this screen shot.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The main components are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Red</strong>: The applications navigation menu where you select the actions you want to perform.</li>
      <li><strong>Green</strong>: In the section to the right of the navigation you often have a table like the one here. There are tools available to filter, navigate and sort the table.</li>
      <li><strong>Blue</strong>: If there is a table in the green area, often there is the possibility to see more details for the objects that are displayed in the table by clicking on them. If this is the case, you will see more details pop up in the blue marked area.</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow</strong>: Throughout the whole application you have the possibility to change the display language as well as the table size. The table size is the number of entries that is usually displayed per page in tables.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will mostly only use the left mouse button for clicking. There are very few instances where the right mouse button is used.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="modules" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#modules"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Modules</a></h2>
      <p>The <em>OSCE Manager</em> consists of several modules that play together. In the navigation menu of the software you see several boxes that basically make up these modules. In figure 1-3 you see all the elements of said menu.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/1-3-navigation.png" title="Navigation menu of the *OSCE Manager*" alt="1-3: Navigation menu of the OSCE Manager." /><p class="caption">1-3: Navigation menu of the OSCE Manager.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The elements <em>SP</em>, <em>Examiners</em>, <em>Role</em>, <em>OSCE Administration</em> and <em>System Administrations</em> are outlining everything that is possible in this application.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Under <strong>SP</strong>, the simulated patient database can be found. There, you have the possibility to enter SP data, search for SPs, create and edit a custom questionnaire that you want SPs to fill out and you may also define body attributes that SPs may have.</li>
      <li><strong>Examiners</strong> contains the database of examiners, that could participate in OSCEs. It is structured similar to the SP database, but is less sophisticated. In the <em>OSCE Manager</em>, examiners belong to clinics, which are also managed within this module.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Role</strong> menu entry is basically a database of all the roles that could be used or played by an SP during an OSCE, wehereas each role consists of everything required to discribe it such as scripts, checklists, inventory lists, etc. The roles are categorized and these categories are managed within this module as well.</li>
      <li>In <strong>OSCE Administration</strong> you plan, schedule, execute and analyse the OSCE. For each semester in which you want to organize OSCEs you usually go through a step-by-step progress that is mirrored by this menu.</li>
      <li><strong>System Administration</strong> is a collection of things and tools that are not used on a daily basis. These are mainly masks for entering specific data into the database that has not to be regularly used or updated, such as the rooms which could be used for conducting an OSCE within.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Detailed descriptions of the modules can be found in the respective chapters.</p>
      <p>As mentioned in <a href="#system-architecture">chapter 1.1</a>, there is also the <em>SP Portal</em>, which could be considered a module as well, but is actually rather a tool that helps you work with the modules <strong>SP</strong> and <strong>OSCE Administration</strong>.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div id="the-simulated-patient-database" class="section level1">
      <h1><a href="#the-simulated-patient-database"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The simulated patient database</a></h1>
      <p>The simulated patient or SP database is a core part of the OSCE Manager application. Stored within it are all the SPs that did or will participate in an OSCE. This chapter focuses on working with said database and explains what can be done with it. Note, that some functionality is aided by the <em>SP Portal</em> which will be explained in <a href="#the-sp-portal">chapter 6</a>.</p>
      <div id="sp-table-view" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#sp-table-view"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> SP table view</a></h2>
      <p>When opening the SP database view by clicking on <em>Simulated patients</em> in the main menu, you will be confronted with a table which contains all the SPs that are stored in the database. The table has some features which you will find throughout the <em>OSCE Manager</em> in other tables.</p>
      <p>In figure 2-1, highlighted in blue, you see the list of SPs that are in the database. When you click on a single entry of this table, you get to see the <a href="#sp-details-view">detailed information about an SP</a> in an area that will scroll into the screen on the right side.</p>
      <p>The number of records you see is governed by the <em>table size</em> setting in the top right, marked in orange. you can use the <em>pager</em> on the right side below the table (highlighted in yellow) to browse to the entries that can not be displayed on the first page. Marked in red, you see the <a href="#quick-search">quick search field and search settings</a> that can be used for simple text search of the database. The green column bar allows you to <a href="#sorting">sort the table</a> and <a href="#sorting">select the columns to display</a>.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/2-1-sp_table.png" alt="2-1: The SP database table with the quick search field (red), column bar (green), the tables contents (blue), the &quot;Add SP&quot;-button (pink), the pager (yellow) and the advanced filters (turquoise)." /><p class="caption">2-1: The SP database table with the quick search field (red), column bar (green), the tables contents (blue), the &quot;Add SP&quot;-button (pink), the pager (yellow) and the advanced filters (turquoise).</p>
      </div>
      <p>If you want to create a new entry in the database you click on the <em>Add SP</em> button <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> (highlighted in pink). This will present you with the <a href="#editing-sp_data">SP editing view</a>. Finally, there are also <a href="#advanced-filters">advanced filtering features</a> that allow you to narrow down the search even more.</p>
      <div id="sorting" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#sorting"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Sorting</a></h3>
      <p>The column controls pictured in figure 2-2 allow you to sort the table by any column available.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/2-2-column-controls.png" alt="2-2: Column controls" /><p class="caption">2-2: Column controls</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Sorting a table by an arbitrary column</strong></p>
      <p>To sort the table by a certain column:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click on the name of the column by which you want to sort the data! <img src="img/examples/sorting-1.png" alt="a" /></li>
      <li>You now see, that the table is sorted by first name. This is also indicated by the arrow besides the column name. To reverse the sort order, simply click the same column name again. <img src="img/examples/sorting-2.png" alt="a" /></li>
      <li>As you can see, the sort order has been reversed. <img src="img/examples/sorting-3.png" alt="a" /></li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Additionally, you have the possibility to select the columns which you want to display in the table.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Selecting the displayed columns</strong></p>
      <p>To display additional columns:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

      <div id="quick-search" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#quick-search"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Quick search</a></h3>
      <p>The quick search window on the top left of the SP table allows you to search for any text within the SP records. As soon as you enter any text in the search field, the table will be filtered and only SPs that match your search will be shown.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Searching for an SP by name</strong></p>
      <p>To search for an SP by name, e.g. you search for Mr. <em>Henry Jones</em>.</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click the search box on the top left of the screen. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-1.png" alt="Click the search box" /></li>
      <li>Enter their name, e.g. <em>Henry</em> and you will see the results almost immediately. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-2.png" alt="Enter the name of the person you want to search" /></li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Besides searching for SPs by name you can also search by other attributes.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: General use of quick search</strong></p>
      <p>To search for an SP by city, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Move the cursor over the wrench symbol to the right of the search box <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-3.png" alt="Move the cursor over the wrench symbol" /></li>
      <li>Click the columns in which you want to search, e.g. <em>City</em>. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-4.png" alt="Click the columns in which you want to search" /></li>
      <li>Enter the search term you want to search by, e.g. the name of the city. As in the previous example you will see the results almost immediately. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-5.png" alt="Enter the search term" /></li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>As you could see in the two examples you can search the following columns via the quick search box: <em>Name</em>, <em>First Name</em>, <em>Postal code</em>, <em>City</em>, <em>Street</em>, <em>Telephone</em>, <em>Telephone 2</em>, <em>Mobile</em>, <em>Email</em>, <em>Bank</em>, <em>BIC</em>, <em>IBAN</em>, <em>Comment</em>.</p>
      <p>A click on the arrow symbol <img src="img/icons/arrowrefresh-1-w.png" alt="refresh arrow icon" /> executes the search once again.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div id="advanced-filters" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#advanced-filters"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Advanced filters</a></h2>
      <p>Since there are many non-textual fields that characterise an SP in the database, more sophisticated search methods are available. With the advanced filters that can be found below the SP table, it is possible to filter the table by numeric ranges, gender, profession or even custom information defined in the <a href="#the-questionnaire">questionnaire</a>.</p>
      <p>This filter functionality can be found in the <a href="#role-management">role management chapter</a> again. There, the exact same filters can be used to define which criteria a simulated patient must fulfill to be suited for a certain role.</p>
      <p>To filter the table with one of the advanced filters, click on one of the available filter buttons shown in figure 2-4.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/2-4-advanced_filters.png" alt="2-4: The advanced filters, available for searching SPs" /><p class="caption">2-4: The advanced filters, available for searching SPs</p>
      </div>
      <p>After you click on one of the buttons a dialog window comes up. For example, if you click on the <em>numeric filter</em> button <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />, a dialog like the one shown in figure 2-5 appears.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/2-5-numeric_filter.png" alt="2-5: The numeric filter box with the linkage field, parameter field, comparison field and the value field." /><p class="caption">2-5: The numeric filter box with the linkage field, parameter field, comparison field and the value field.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Most of the filters and filter options are rather straight forward and don't need a lot of explanation. The ones that do are treated in the following three chapters.</p>
      <div id="linkage" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#linkage"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Linkage</a></h3>
      <p>The leftmost dropdown menu from figure 2-5 is the same for all of the filter boxes. It contains the linkage operation which defines how the filter is applied in conjunction with the preceding filter. The two possible values are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>OR</strong>: means that an SP has to match with either the preceding filter <em>or</em> the filter that is getting the <em>OR</em>-linkage attribute.</li>
      <li><strong>AND</strong>: defines that the criteria of this current filter <em>and</em> the criteria of the previous filter have to apply <em>both</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note, that the order of criteria is relevant for the linkage-attribute. The linkage setting of the first-defined filter is irrelevant, but the last criterion is always the strongest.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Using multiple search filters</strong></p>
      <p>You want to search for female SPs that are either more than 60 years old or younger than 30 years old. Thus, you'd follow these steps:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click on the <em>gender</em> button <img src="img/icons/person.png" alt="person icon" />. In the menu that appears you select the gender to be <em>female</em>. <img src="img/examples/2-1-gender.png" alt="Adding a filter by gender" /></li>
      <li>Now you select women who are younger than 30. To do that you click on the <em>numeric filter</em> button <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />, select the <em>smaller than</em> sign (<em>&lt;</em>) and enter the number 30. <img src="img/examples/2-2-age30.png" alt="Adding a filter by age" /></li>
      <li>Finally, you do the same as in item two, but now you select the <em>larger than</em> sign (<em>&gt;</em>), enter the number 60 and select the <em>linkage</em> to be of type <em>OR</em>. <img src="img/examples/2-3-age60.png" alt="Adding a filter by age" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you have a look at the result now, you will notice that there are male SPs in the result. This is because the last criterion is linked with <em>OR</em>-Linkage, which basically makes this selection to be: <em>Show all SPs who are female and younger than 30 years old, or show all SPs who are older than 60 years old</em>.</p>
      <p>Instead we wanted a selection which shows <em>all SPs who are younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years old and are female</em>. To achieve this now, we continue:</p>
      <ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>In the criteria table that appeared, click on the trash symbol <img src="img/icons/trash.png" alt="trash icon" /> besides the filter where you filtered by gender. <img src="img/examples/2-4-remove_filter.png" alt="Removing a filter" /></li>
      <li>Now we add the same filter again at the end of the list, as described in item 1. (Click on the <em>gender</em> button. In the menu that appears you select the gender to be <em>female</em>.) <img src="img/examples/2-1-gender.png" alt="Adding the filter by gender to the end of the filter list" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now you see the results you actually wanted.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/examples/2-5-results.png" alt="The SP database, showing only SPs who are female and either younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years." /><p class="caption">The SP database, showing only SPs who are female and either younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years.</p>

      <div id="comparisons" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#comparisons"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Comparisons</a></h3>
      <p>Most filters have a comparison operation, where in the simplest case you can just select whether an SP should have a certain attribute or not. For example when using the <em>Profession</em>-filter, you can select if the SP should have a certain profession, but it is also possible to select that he must not have a certain profession.</p>
      <p>The <em>numeric filter</em> allows for mathematical comparisons such as <em>equal</em> (=), <em>not equal</em> (≠), <em>greater than</em> (&gt;) and <em>less than</em> (&lt;). Similarly the <em>Languages</em> filter allows the same comparisons to language skill levels.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="attribute-and-questionnaire-filters" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#attribute-and-questionnaire-filters"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Attribute and Questionnaire filters</a></h3>
      <p>Whereas most of the filters are rather straight forward to use, the <em>Attributes</em> and <em>Questionnaire</em> filters are special. The <em>Attributes</em> filter, shown in figure 2-6, is used to search for user definable attributes (see chapter <a href="#define-and-use-attributes">Define and use attributes</a>). It is easy to use, as it only shows a simple drop-down menu from which you can select all of the available attributes.</p>
      <div class="figure">

The drop-down menu shows all the attributes that are available for selection.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The more interesting filter is the <em>Questionnaire</em> filter. In it, the <a href="#the-questionnaire">questionnaire</a> can be searched. This is a collection of user definable questions, that each SP can answer. For more information on how to use the questionnaire, plese see <a href="#the-questionnaire">the chapter in question</a>. With this filter it is possible to efficiently search this questionnaire. When you first click the <em>Questionnaire</em> filter button, you are confronted with a text field into which you can type a keyword to help find the question (see figure 2-7). As soon as you enter something into this textbox, a menu with matching questions appears.</p>

      </div>
      <p>After selecting a question, you can define what answer you are looking for. Depending on the type of the question, either a drop-down menu appears (see figure 2-8) for multiple choice or yes/no-questions, in which you can select the answer you are looking for, or in case of an open question answered with written text, you can enter text in a textbox (see figure 2-9).</p>

      <p><strong>Example: Searching SPs by questionnaire items</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Important</strong>: <em>Note, that you have to have these questions defined in the questionnaire before this example works. See chapter <a href="#the-questionnaire">The questionnaire</a>.</em></p>
      <p>You want to list all the SPs that wear glasses and are motivated by money. This means that the questionnaire has to have some questions defined, which cover these two points. In our example the two following questions are predefined:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Do you wear glasses?</li>
      <li>What motivated you to participate in our simulation patient program?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first of the above questions is a Yes/No question, while the latter is an open question.</p>
      <p>To create the filters, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click on the <em>Questionnaire</em> button <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" />. <img src="img/examples/3-1-questionnaire.png" alt="Click on the Questionnaire button" /></li>
      <li>Enter the word &quot;glasses&quot;. A selection box should appear, displaying every question in the database that contains the word &quot;glasses&quot;. In the example there is only one available, the question <em>Do you wear glasses</em>, which you now select by clicking it. <img src="img/examples/3-2-glasses.png" alt="Enter the word &quot;glasses&quot;..." /></li>
      <li>Make sure that the two drop-down-menus are set to <em>answered with</em> and <em>Yes</em>, then click <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> <em>Add</em>. <img src="img/examples/3-3-add.png" alt="Add" /></li>
      <li>Now to add the second filter you click the <em>Questionnaire</em> button <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> again.</li>
      <li>Enter the word <em>&quot;motiv&quot;</em> and select the question <em>What motivated you to participate in our simulation patient program?</em>. <img src="img/examples/3-4-motiv.png" alt="Enter the word &quot;motiv&quot;" /></li>
      <li>Make sure that the drop-down-menu reads <em>ansawered with</em> and enter the word <em>&quot;money&quot;</em> in the textbox. Then, click <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus-icon" /> <em>Add</em>. <img src="img/examples/3-5-money.png" alt="Add" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now you see all the simulated patients that wear glasses and answered the motivation-question with an answer containing the word <em>&quot;money&quot;</em>.</p>

      <h3><a href="#editing-sp-data"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Editing SP data</a></h3>
      <p>There are several types of data that can be edited. Let's concentrate on the SPs basic data first. The following example shows you how to change SP details. When you click on <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> <em>Add SP</em> below the <a href="#sp-table-view">SP table view</a> or if you click on <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> <em>Edit</em> in the controls panel in the top right of the screen, the same mask will show. So the procedure for editing SP data or adding a new SP is basically the same.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Adding a new SP or Editing SP basic data</strong></p>
      <p>We want to edit some basic attributes of the simulated patient <em>Isaac Hausner</em>. After we selected him in the <a href="#sp-table-view">SP table view</a> by clicking on his name, we can edit his data by following these steps:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click on <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> <em>Edit</em> in the controls panel in the top right of the screen. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-1.png" alt="Click on Edit" /></li>
      <li>In the upcoming screen you can edit the name and contact data of the SP. For example you can change his email address. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-2.png" alt="Editing the mail address" /></li>
      <li>If you click on the tab <em>particulars</em>, you're able to edit additional information, such as birth date, height, weight, marital status etc. We can e.g. change his profession by clicking on the profession suggest box and clicking or typing a new profession. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-3.png" alt="Select a new profession" /></li>
      <li>Editing bank account information works the same way. You can enter account number and bank address information in the entry mask. The country dropdown is the same type of dropdown menu as the <em>profession</em> and <em>nationality</em> boxes found in the <em>Particulars</em> tab. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-4.png" alt="Changing bank account information" /></li>
      <li>You may also add comments with custom formatting to each SP. These comments can also be searched using the <a href="#quick-search">quick search</a> and can therefore be used to add custom information. The formatting options are a subset of those found in regular word processing software. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-5.png" alt="Adding comments" /></li>
      <li>After you have done your changes, click on <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="disk icon" /> <em>Save</em> on the top right of the control panel. If you decided to throw away your changes, you can also click on <img src="img/icons/closethick.png" alt="close icon" /> <em>Cancel</em>. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-6.png" alt="Saving your changes" /></li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Additionally, there are some attributes that have to be edited by other means. These would be the <em>Language skill</em>, the <a href="#define-and-use-attributes">attributes</a> and <a href="#answering-questions">the questionnaire</a>. The latter two are treated in their own chapters.</p>
      <p>You may want to have certain SPs who are able to communicate in certain languages. The language skills tab allows you to specifically define which languages a simulated patient is able to speak on what level.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Editing language skills</strong></p>
      <p>You want to add language skills to a certain SP.</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Go to the <em>Language skills</em> tab in the <a href="#sp-details-view">SP details view</a>. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-1.png" alt="Select the language skills tab" /></li>
      <li>Select one of the pre-defined languages from the language drop down. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-2.png" alt="Select a language" /></li>
      <li>Select the skill level at which the SP is speaking this language. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-3.png" alt="Select the language skill level" /></li>

      <h3><a href="#status-deletion-and-synchronisation"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Status, deletion and synchronisation</a></h3>
      <p>In the SP database, each SP has a status. There are several statuses an SP can be in and these all have different implications which mainly show in the possible actions of the control panel. In the following list, the implications of each status is described.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Active</strong>: This is the default status and means, that the SP is available for OSCEs and can be modified in any way you like.</li>
      <li><strong>Inactive</strong>: An SP can be excluded from participating in future OSCEs by deactivating the SP. This means, that he cannot be selected in any new OSCEs and his data can not be exported to the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a></li>
      <li><strong>Anonymized</strong>: After an SP has decided that he does not want to take part in any OSCEs anymore but he has been in OSCEs in the past, the SP can be anonyized. This means that any personal data of the SP gets erased.</li>
      <li><strong>Exported</strong>: This status indicates, that the SPs personal data is currently accessible through the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a> and to prevent inconsistencies the SPs data can not be edited.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now a few examples follow to help you with actions that are relevant to the statuses.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Deleting / anonymizing an SP</strong></p>
      <p>To delete an SP, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>After you selected the SP to delete from the table, click on the <a href="img/icons/trash.png">trash icon</a> <em>Delete</em> button on the right side of the SP controls panel. <img src="img/examples/delete-sp-1.png" alt="Click the delete button" /></li>
      <li>You will be presented with a pop-up that asks you for confirmation. In this pop-up, click &quot;OK&quot;. <img src="img/examples/delete-sp-2.png" alt="Confirm delete" /></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the SP has already been assigned to a role in an OSCE in the past, the SP cannot be physically deleted from the database. Instead, all SP data will be <em>anonymized</em> (replaced with <em>xxx</em>).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Deactivating and reactivating an SP</strong></p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>If an SP should be deactivated, click on the <img src="img/icons/closethick.png" alt="close icon" /> <em>Deactivate</em> button.

      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>After you've made sure that the SP is in an active state, click the <img src="img/icons/extlink.png" alt="extlink icon" /> <em>Sent To DMZ</em> button. This sends the SP data to the DMZ (<em>Demilitarized Zone</em> - in this case a server that is accessible publicly over the internet) so it can be accessed via the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a> <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-1.png" alt="Send to DMZ" /></li>
      <li>if the export was successful, you will be notified. <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-2.png" alt="Send to DMZ successful!" /></li>
      <li>Now the SP can log in to the SP Portal and edit his data (<a href="#the-sp-portal">see chapter 6</a>)</li>
      <li>After the SP has come through and updated his details on the SP Portal, you can reimport the data by clicking on <img src="img/icons/arrowthickstop-1-s.png" alt="arrow icon" /> <em>Pull From DMZ</em> to reimport the data. <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-3.png" alt="Pull From DMZ" /></li>

      <p>For SPs it is often desirable to exclude certain body parts from examination, e.g. if they are scarred somewhere or just don't feel comfortable with it. Defining such attributes could later on help in assigning suited SPs to roles.</p>
      <p>There are three different types of <em>attributes</em>: <em>scar</em>, <em>tattoo</em> and <em>Do not examine</em>. Use them where appropriate - <em>scar</em> if you define a scar, <em>tattoo</em> if you define a tattoo and <em>Do not examine</em> if there is some other reason a certain body part should not be examined.</p>
      <p>All the attributes can be found when you click on <em>Attributes</em> in the <em>SP</em>-section of the <em>OSCE Managers</em> navigation. You will be presented with a table showing all the predefined attributes and the option to add new attributes.</p>

      <h1><a href="#role-management"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Role management</a></h1>
      <p>In this part of the OSCE Manager application you can manage roles. Roles <em>encompass everything that is tied to one station in an OSCE where one particular skill is tested and usually an SP plays the role</em>. All the roles that will be resorted back to during an OSCE have to be <em>previously</em> defined here. If you want to change an aspect of a role, such as the SPs script, you usually just edit the role and don't create a new role just foor that.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>A quick sidenote about terminology: The <em>role</em> basically describes every aspect of what will be called a <em>station</em> during an OSCE. Since the role is universal (i.e. it has nothing to do with a specific room or OSCE), we do not call it a station. The term <em>station</em> will be used when organising an OSCE and assigning a <em>role</em> to a room in which the role will be played. Basically you can see the roles as tasks for the students.</p>

      <p>Roles are grouped into disciplines and skills. Each role tests one particular skill, which in turn belongs to a certain discipline. For example there may be a discipline <em>Ophthalmology</em> within which there are several skills that you may want to test, e.g. <em>Ocular Tonometry</em> and <em>Ophtalmoscopy</em>.</p>
      <p>Through this categorisation of roles it is easier to find the right roles when you start organising an OSCE.</p>

      <li>The <strong>basic controls</strong> on the title bar, to the right of the roles full name, contains some basic actions that apply to the role as a whole, such as <strong>viewing previous versions</strong> of the role, <strong>editing</strong> the basic information of the role, <strong>copying the role</strong>, <strong>printing the role</strong> or even <strong>deleting</strong> the role.</li>
      <li>The <strong>details tabs</strong> group all the information into appropriate categories:
      <ul>
      <li>The <strong>top row of tabs</strong> is used for editing some <a href="#basic-role-information"><strong>basic information</strong> about the role</a>, such as information about who wrote it, keywords to find it and in which OSCEs it has been used.

      <p>The mask that you see contains the following fields:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Acronym</strong>: This is an abbreviation or a <strong>short hand name for a role</strong>. It will be displayed anywhere where a short hand name is more convenient. Please choose a name that makes it clear what role is meant.</li>
      <li><strong>Role designation</strong>: This is the full and descriptive name of the role. This will be used whenever there is enough space available to display the full name of the role.</li>
      <li><strong>Role type</strong>: There are three possibilites for this option:
      <ul>
      <li><strong>SimPat</strong>: designates a regular role, where a simulated patient has to be examined by the student.</li>
      <li><strong>Supernumerary</strong>: a role where someone has to play a role which doesn't involve being examined.</li>
      <li><strong>Material</strong>: a role where only some equipment is required, but no one has to play any role.</li>
      </ul>
      Note, that the distinction between <em>SimPat</em> and <em>Supernumerary</em> mainly exists for cost calculation reasons.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Year</strong>: This allows you once again to define in which academic year a role is to be tested in the OSCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill</strong>: This allows you to change the skill to which the role belongs.</li>
      <li><strong>Absolute number of backup-SPs</strong>: This is the absolute minimum number of SPs that would be on backup for this station during an OSCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Proportion of backup-SPs vs. no. of circuis</strong>: The number of SPs that are on backup per circuit for this role. I.e. if this role is used on four circuits in parallel at an OSCE, the stated number of SPs times 4 have to be there as backups.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you go to the checklist tab, you'll see only one field where you can give a designation to the checklist of this role.</p>

      <p>You can also <strong>copy</strong> a role. To do this, simply click on the <img src="img/icons/copy.png" alt="icon-copy" /> <em>Copy</em> button in the control bar on the top right side. This creates a copy of the current role.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Important</em>: Be aware that as of the time of writing this manual, checklists and scripts are not copied; that means that a copy of a role references the same checklist and script as the original, and changes to either of those will be seen from both roles.</p>

      <h3><a href="#roles-and-versions"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Roles and versions</a></h3>
      <p>Over time you may want to change a role. Maybe you've had a role that you had in an OSCE for two consecutive years, but now you want to change some parts of it to not let the students' information exchange ruin the novelty of the role. Thus you decide to change some symptoms and therefore the SPs role and the checklist have to be changed. Now the OSCEs that were held in the past still used the role with the old checklist and script, and you want to keep it that way. Now what to do?</p>
      <p>Luckily, the roles have versions. If you go to the <a href="#creating-copying-or-editing-a-role">editing screen</a> and click on the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> <em>Save</em> button you will be presented with the following dialog:</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/major-minor.png" alt="Selection between major changes or minor changes" /><p class="caption">Selection between major changes or minor changes</p>
      </div>
      <p>You can select between:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Major changes</strong>: This is what you would want to do in the above scenario. This effectively creates a copy of the role as it was and archives it.</li>
      <li><strong>Minor changes</strong>: If you don't need to access an old version and just did some small changes, you select minor changes. This just overwrites the current version of the role.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Everytime you make a change <strong>that triggers the appearence of the version dialog</strong>, and you select either <em>Minor</em> or <em>Major changes</em>, the version number of the role gets updated. In case of a major change, the number before the dot gets bumped and the number after the dot gets reset to zero (e.g. from 1.2 to 2.0). In case of a minor change, the number behind the dot is increased by one.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Important</em>: Note, that this dialog only appears when you either save changes, that you made in the <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> <a href="#creating-copying-or-editing-a-role"><em>Edit</em> screen of the role</a> or when you save changes you made to the <a href="#role-scripts">role scripts</a>. If you change any other aspect of the role, even the <a href="#checklist">checklist</a>, you will not be asked about a version change. Thus, if you know you're going to make significant changes to a role, you have to take care of correct versioning yourself!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since the role gets archived when you do <em>major changes</em> to it, you can still access old versions of the role if you want to by clicking the <img src="img/icons/rwd.png" alt="icon-rwd" /> <em>Previous version</em> button in the main control bar. If you are currently looking at an older version of a role you will notice this by the fact that you can't make any changes. To access future versions, click on the appropriate <img src="img/icons/fwd.png" alt="icon-fwd" /> <em>Next version</em> or <img src="img/icons/end.png" alt="icon-end" /> <em>Current version</em> buttons.</p>

      <p>What you see in this perspective are several things. All the documents that are contained within the selected document component can be seen. Each of these documents does have:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A <strong>title / description</strong>. This should tell you what this document should contain. In the example above we have e.g. &quot;Task description&quot; which is a pretty obvious hint.</li>
      <li>A <em>box containing the</em> <strong>intended audience</strong> of this document. This can be used when printing the role, to only print what you actually need. Maybe you have trainings for simulated patients for which you already need the scripts for the SPs. Then you only print the documents that are designated with &quot;SP&quot;.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These last two items have to be predefined in the document components. The only thing you can actually do here is:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Change the document components</strong> that this role uses by selecting another document component template from the dropdown menu on the bottom of the screen and clicking <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="icon-plus" /> <em>Select document components</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Edit the actual documents</strong> by clicking the Edit button <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> for the appropriate document.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you <strong>edit a document</strong> by clicking the <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> edit button, you will see a rich-text editor such as the one you already saw in the <a href="#editing-sp-data">edit SP view</a>. It's feature-set is just a limited set of the ones found in general word processing software. After you're done editing the document, click on the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> save button to save your changes. You will be asked whether this is a minor or major change to the role (see <a href="#roles-and-versions">Roles and versions</a> for explanation).</p>

      <h1><a href="#osce-creation-administration"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> OSCE creation &amp; administration</a></h1>
      <p>This chapter describes how you would approach to prepare the actual exam. To be able to seriously start organising an OSCE, it is assumed that you already prepared your database of <a href="#the-simulated-patient-database">simulated patients</a>, <a href="#the-examiner-database">examiners</a> and <a href="#role-management">role definitions</a>.</p>
      <p>If you intend to use one of the <a href="#creating-stations">more complex types of stations</a>, make sure that you prepared the roles for these appropriately.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the menu on the left, whithin the OSCE Manager the whole process of running an OSCE is basically divided into 4 sections that you will usually go through in sequence:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>Create an OSCE</em>: Define the framework of the OSCE, such as when it will take place, which academic year of students is going to take part, how long should it take, how many participants are there and what role will be played where.</li>
      <li><em>Assignments</em>: After the framework is defined and a timetable is calculated, you can assign students, examiners and SPs to timeslots and fine-tune the schedules.</li>
      <li><em>OSCEManager Output</em>: When everything is set, you can use the OSCE Manager to send invitations, print schedules or export data to <a href="http://www.e-osce.ch/" title="Website of eOSCE - Efficient medical Exams on iPads">eOSCE</a>.</li>
      <li><em>Analysis</em>: After the OSCEs are over, you can re-import data from <em>eOSCE</em> and statistically evaluate the results of the exam within the OSCE Manager itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="preparation" class="section level2">
      <h2><a href="#preparation"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Preparation</a></h2>
      <p>The OSCE Manager assumes that you are going to organise your OSCEs per semester. Thus, all the OSCEs that take place within the same semester are grouped together.</p>
      <p>So to start organising your OSCE, you have to define a semester in which it will take place. You do this by defining year and semester.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Example: Define a semester</strong></p>
      <p>To define a new semester in which the OSCE will take place:</p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Click on the <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> button besides the semester dropdown box in the OSCE Managers main menu on the left side of the screen. <img src="img/osce-semester-create-1.png" alt="a" /></li>
      <li>In the window that pops up, you can enter the year in which the OSCE should take place and select the Semester (FS for spring, HS for autumn, Federal for federal exams). You can leave the other fields empty. <img src="img/osce-semester-create-2.png" alt="a" /></li>
      <li>Make sure that the semester you just created is actually selected in the dropdown menu on the left. If not, please select it. <img src="img/osce-semester-create-3.png" alt="a" /></li>
      </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You may have noticed that the creation of the semester also contains three fields related to finances. These fields could be used if you would want to wage accounting for SPs within the OSCE Manager. So this would give you the possibility to define the hourly wages for SPs and extras as well as a limit of the yearly total expenses for SP/extra salaries. <strong>These values do not have to be filled in.</strong> If you decide to fill these in at a later point, you can do so by clicking the edit button <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> in the OSCE Managers main menu on the left.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Note that the semester is just a tool used within the OSCE Manager to categorize OSCEs. There are will be no constraints concerning the time frame in which the OSCE can take place!</em></p>

      <h2><a href="#create-an-osce"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Create an OSCE</a></h2>
      <p>This chapter explains the process of creating an OSCE from scratch. One very important aspect is to schedule the OSCE and the creation of the time tables. The OSCE Manager assists you in lots of these tasks and can create the time table automatically. For this to work as intended though, you have to set some parameters of course. This chapter will help you determine the right parameters, so in the end you will have a time table for your OSCE.</p>
      <div id="creating-a-new-osce" class="section level3">
      <h3><a href="#creating-a-new-osce"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Creating a new OSCE</a></h3>
      <p>After you've <a href="#preparation">defined the semester</a> in which the OSCE should take place, you have to define the framework first. To start with this process you click on <em>Define basic data</em> in the OSCE Managers main menu on the left. You will be presented with an empty table.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/osce-create-new-osce.png" alt="After clicking on define basic data in the main menu you see this empty table. To create a new OSCE click on the appropriate button." /><p class="caption">After clicking on <em>define basic data</em> in the main menu you see this empty table. To create a new OSCE click on the appropriate button.</p>
      </div>
      <p>You will be presented with the form shown below, in which you have to define the framework of the OSCE.</p>
      <div class="figure">
      <img src="img/osce-create-new-osce-form.png" alt="Form for defining the OSCEs basic data" /><p class="caption">Form for defining the OSCEs basic data</p>
      </div>
      <p>In the screenshot shown above, there are several parameters - mainly numeric values - to be defined. Some realistic sample values were filled in. The OSCE Manager uses these parameters to later automatically calculate the time tables. Therefore it is of course also necessary to correctly define the times required for stations and breaks between stations.</p>
      <p>The following list describes the available settings:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Remarks:</strong> This lets you add a few descriptive words to an OSCE. Currently, there are menus in the application in which this is the only feedback the user has for identifying an OSCE. Thus, it is advised to use something descriptive that uniquely identifies this OSCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic Year:</strong> Defines the academic year for which this particular OSCE will be conducted. If it targets e.g. students in the first year of their masters you would select &quot;1. MA&quot;.</li>
      <li><strong>Repetition of OSCE:</strong> This is used if you want to conduct an OSCE aimed at students who failed the actual OSCE. If you check the field <em>&quot;Is this a repetition of an earlier OSCE?&quot;</em>, you select the original OSCE that the students failed via this suggestive search field.</li>
      <li><strong>Max. circuits:</strong> lets you define the maximum number of circuits that will be run in parallel at this OSCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Max. students:</strong> lets you define the maximum number of students that will take part in the OSCE.</li>
      <li><strong>Max. number of rooms:</strong> set the maximum number of rooms that will be available to you for conducting the OSCE. This concerns only rooms in which there will be a station!</li>
      <li><strong>Station duration:</strong> the time in minutes, that each student has available per station.</li>
      <li><strong>Short break duration:</strong> A short break occurs always after the time for a station ran out. This is the time a student has to switch to the next station.</li>
      <li><strong>Short break with SP-changeover:</strong> This is used where <a href="#defining-and-editing-skills">skills are tested that strain the SP significantly</a>. Because of this there could be a necessity for an SP to be relieved mid-rotation and the short break could be too short to allow for this.</li>
      <li><strong>Medium break duration:</strong> The medium break occurs between the end of the last station of a circuit and the beginning of a new circuit, i.e. if a group of students finished their OSCE rotation and the next group of students comes in for their rotation.</li>
      <li><strong>Long break duration:</strong> This is a special sort of break that allows you to have longer breaks e.g. coffee breaks for SPs and examiners in place of medium breaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Max. time until long break:</strong> The amount of time that has to pass from the beginning of the OSCE, the last long break or the last lunch break until a long break will take place.</li>
      <li><strong>Lunch break duration:</strong> the lunch break allows you to have yet another break with a different duration for having lunch. <strong>Important:</strong> The lunch break has the side effect of splitting the OSCE in two, which will later on give you the possibility to define a different set of stations before and after lunch breaks.</li>
      <li><strong>Max. time until lunch break:</strong> As with the corresponding setting for long breaks, this lets you define the amount of time from the beginning of the OSCE to the lunch break.</li>
      <li><strong>Import tasks from...:</strong> You may import <a href="#tasks">the task list</a> of an existing OSCE by selecting it here. Note that currently, the only information identifying the OSCE from which you want to import is the <em>Remarks</em> field...</li>
      <li><strong>SP stays at station:</strong> If this box is checked, SPs will stay at a station and there will be no rotations of SPs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that under normal circumstances at least the short break, medium break and lunch breaks will occur. But there are lots of possibilities to tweak the schedule and lots of the scenarios can be achieved by tweaking the time table accordingly. For more details and tips on adjusting timing of the OSCE, see the <a href="#edit-circuit-details">next chapter</a>.</p>
      <p>When you are finished entering these values, you can save this OSCE by clicking on the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> <em>Save</em> button on the top right of the screen. The OSCE you created will then appear in the table on the left. You can continue to enter basic data for more OSCEs that will take place in the same semester.</p>

      <p>In the center of the screen you will see a blue colord box labeled &quot;Station type&quot;. This is the box you use to create new stations. At first you have to define the general type of station, which you will do by selecting the type you require in the dropdown menu. Selecting a type of station creates the station.</p>

      <p>The following types of stations are available:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Regular Station:</strong> This is a straight forward station and will probably be used most often. You can assign one regular role to this type of station.</li>
      <li><strong>Break:</strong> This is a spot where a student will wait for the duration of one station.</li>
      <li><strong>Double Station:</strong> A type of station that has double the duration of a regular station (i.e. takes two consecutive timeslots). Because the double station takes up two timeslots, there will always have to be an even number of these per circuit. That is the reason you have to select two skills and two different rooms when setting up the double station in the OSCE manager.</li>
      <li><strong>Preparation Station:</strong> This takes up two consecutive time slots as well, but the intention here is, that a student will have time to prepare for the actual task in a seperate room beforehand. So here, the seperate skills are not for different stations, but would allow you to define different parts of the task. So, you could e.g. split the skill you want to test into two roles, one containing only the information required by the student to prepare and the other containing the evaluation checklists and SP role scripts as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After you've defined a station type, the station will be created as seen in the sceenshot below.</p>

E.g. in all stations where the CPR skill is tested, it will be tested the same way.</p>
      <p>You may notice that in this example, with the given constraints, it was not possible to schedule the OSCE in one day. If you would want to conduct this OSCE in one single day (the same number of stations and students as well as the same duration per station), you would either have to <em>allow it to use up more time</em> or <em>allocate more resources</em> to it (allow for more rooms and circuits).</p>

      <h4><a href="#adjusting-the-scheduling-of-the-circuit"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2.7</span> Adjusting the scheduling of the circuit</a></h4>
      <p>The given example resulted in an OSCE that was spread out to two days. If you can't change the timing constraints before the generation stage, you still have a few possibilites to tune the outcome. To adjust the schedules, you have the possibility to move rotations between days as well as move the lunch breaks.</p>
      <p>You also have the possibility to split the sequence of one day into two distinct sequences, so that you could change the roles played for the two. The intention of this is to prevent students who take the exam early to give useful information to the ones taking the exam later. By having different roles in the morning and the afternoon, testing the same skills, this would be possible.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Important</strong></p>
      <p>Note, that more detailed adjustments to the schedule are still possible later, in the actual time table. There, you will have the possibility to adjust the duration of every break!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There are several things you can read from the circuit details view after the OSCE circuits have been generated.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You will see each date at which an OSCE takes place. All the days required to conduct an OSCE are displayed above each other.</li>
      <li>You will see the times that have been calculated for:
      <ul>
      <li>the lunch break</li>
      <li>the end of the day of exams</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Every day shown will have all the circuits displayed. As previously stated, this allows you to change the roles played on different days.</li>
      <li>You see the number of rotations that will take place every day.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is now possible to shift lunch breaks and rotations using the appropriate buttons. Each sequence has up to four buttons, allowing you to shift the lunch break or to shift rotations to adjacent sequences.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><img src="img/icons/triangle-1-n.png" alt="icon-triangle-1-n" /> <em>Earlier lunch:</em> This shifts the lunch break to a slot one rotation earlier.</li>

      <li><img src="img/icons/triangle-1-s.png" alt="icon-triangle-1-s" /> <em>Postpone last rotation to next day:</em> the final rotation on this day will be shifted to be the first rotation of the following day. If there is not yet another day in the schedule, one will be created.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be aware that calculating the results of these actions takes quite some time.</p>
      <p>To split a day into two distinct sequences, click the <img src="img/icons/scissors.png" alt="icon-scissors" /> split sequence button. This will result in the sequence being split at the lunch break.</p>

      <p><strong>Example: rescheduling an oddly divided OSCE</strong></p>
      <p>So with all the above information, you may have noticed, that in the example we worked with, the OSCE Manager added a day for only two more rotations. We could now move these two rotations to the first day as to not have an extra day for these. As the first day ends at 17:54 and we don't want to have it take time until 19:00, it would probably be a better desicion to postpone some of the rotations from the first day to the second day, so we have at least a whole morning of OSCE's on the second day.</p>

      <li>Looking at the result, you may notice, that with moving three rotations, we do indeed have a nice, evened out split with 10 rotations on the first day and 5 rotations on the second day. Thus, we have one morning and afternoon on the first day and one whole morning on the second. <img src="img/circuit-x-3.png" /></li>

      <p>Students have to be imported from a text file with comma-separated values (.csv) as they can be generated e.g. in Microsoft Excel. This was implemented this way, because it creates an interface of easy interoperability with a paltform where students can register for their exams online.</p>
      <p>To find out more about the .csv format, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.csv">the wikipedia page</a> or try saving an Excel file as .csv.</p>
      <p>The .csv file to import student data needs to have column designations in the first line to indicate what kind of value can be found in each column. Thus, the order of values does not really matter.</p>
      <p>The columns that may be present are the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>student_id</strong>: A <em>unique</em> numeric id for each student.</li>
      <li><strong>name</strong>: The student's last name.</li>
      <li><strong>prename</strong>: The students first name.</li>
      <li><strong>email_id</strong>: The email address of the student.</li>
      <li><strong>street</strong>: The street address of the student.</li>
      <li><strong>city</strong>: The city the student lives in.</li>
      <li><strong>gender</strong>: Either <em>male</em> or <em>female</em>, denoting the gender of the student.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of the above possible fields of the .csv file, only the fields <em>student_id</em>, <em>name</em> and <em>prename</em> are strictly required. Though, it is advised to also store an email address via the <em>email_id</em> field! The <em>student_id</em> field allows you to modify the student list and overwrite it by re-uploading it.</p>

      <p>The boxes with the role name also show a circled number. This just shows how many SPs you still have to assign to the role to fill each timeslot as needed.</p>
      <p>See the following screenshot for reference. This OSCE is the same one, that was created as an example in chapter <a href="#edit-circuit-details">Edit circuit details</a>. It consists of three stations divided into three circuits. One of the three stations does not require an SP, therefore you see only two stations to assign SPs to. The <em>Tono A</em> role has three SPs assigned, one for each circuit. Thus, the green zero indicating, that no SP is missing. The <em>LOC A</em> station is marked with a negative three, denoting that there are still three SPs missing for this station. If more than the required number of SPs have been assigned to the role, a positive number is displayed and they will be considered as backup SPs.</p>

      <p>You may have noticed, that there is a dropdown menu on the top right of the OSCE day box saying <em>Federal exam</em>. In this dropdown box, you can select two different modes of how many SPs the OSCE Manager expects to be filled in to the roles.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Federal exam</strong>: The OSCE Manager expects one SP per station. One SP can only be assigned to one station.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular OSCE</strong>: The OSCE Manager expects two SPs per station. Each SP can be assigned to two stations. This mode is derived from the practice at the University of Basel to have SPs work a regular SP role for half a day and the other half of the day, they play a role as an extra.</li>

      <p>But first, let's have a more detailed look at the following timetable. You see some marked fields, namely students timeslots (in green), SP timeslots (yellow), examiner timeslots (pink) and breaks (blue). All the actions that have to be done in this view can be done by either using the action buttons in the top right of the view or by left- or right-clicking these schedule fields.</p>

      <p>When clicking on any of the timeslots, you can see who is assigned to this timeslot and the exact times at which the timeslot starts and ends.</p>
      <p>Apart from the timeslots and what they mean, there are some more things you may have noticed in the above screenshot:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>There is another station, &quot;Student break&quot;.</em> This is created automatically because the OSCE manager optimises the schedule in a way to guide as many students through the OSCE at a time. With all the given timing constraints the most effective way seemed to be to have one rotation of four students at first whereas one student has to wait at the break spot once instead of solving a station.</li>
      <li><em>There are two breaks shortly one after another.</em> This is related to the previous point. When you look at the other circuits, you will see, that in the second rotation, there are also four students. As this seemed to be enough to accomodate all the students, there is a short break for the duration of one slot in the pink circuit at this point.</li>
      <li><em>The schedule looks cut off at the bottom.</em> It is, there was a scrollbar omited from the screenshot.</li>

      <p>This is a fairly easy task. But to be able to do this, you have to have the students <a href="#import-student-date">imported</a> into the application first. If that is given, you can let the OSCE Manager automatically assign students to timeslots. To assign students to timeslots, click the button <img src="img/icons/person.png" alt="icon-person" /> <em>Assign students to timeslots</em>.</p>
      <p>A dialog will appear in which you will be warned that this action will delete all the previously made assignments.

      <p><strong>Hint</strong></p>
      <p>You had to enter a number of students that will participate in the OSCE. It is advisable to have the number be as close to the actual number as possible. If there are actually way more students, you have to go back and <a href="#edit-circuit-details">design the circuit from scratch</a>. If there are way less students, you will end up with a lot of unfilled timeslots and thus resources that are unnecessarily bound (SPs, examiners, rooms) even though the OSCE could have been planned more tightly.</p>

      <p>After you've <a href="#sp-selection">assigned SPs to roles</a> you have to assign them to timeslots in the schedule. This is done in the same way as with the students, by simply clicking the <img src="img/icons/contact.png" alt="icon-contact" /> <em>Assign SPs to timeslots</em> button.

      <h4><a href="#assign-examiners-to-timeslots"><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2.3</span> Assign examiners to timeslots</a></h4>
      <p>As opposed to assigning students, assigning examiners has to be done manually for each of the examiner timeslots. To assign an examiner, you just click on the pink timeslot for examiners. You will be presented with a suggestive search field in which you can enter (part of) the name of the examiner and select him from the list. Furthermore, you also have to define until what time the examiner will fulfill this role. This allows to have examiners replace one another during a day if they are not available for whole days. If you select a time before the end time of the OSCE day, the timeslot will be split and you can then assign a different examiner for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>The screenshot collage below illustrates these steps by assigning an examiner for half a day by first clicking on the empty examiner timeslot (1), entering and selecting his name in the SuggestBox (2), selecting the end time of his assignment (3) and then clicking OK (4).</p>

      <p>The assignments can be edited and cleared of course. To do this, just click on an examiner timeslot that already has an assignment. You have the possibility to <img src="img/icons/closethick.png" alt="icon-closethick" /> <em>close</em>, <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> <em>edit</em> or <img src="img/icons/arrowrefresh-1-w.png" alt="icon-arrowrefresh-1-w" /> <em>clear</em>.

      <p>If some SPs or students have scheduling problems, you can swap these out. To do this, you can simply <strong>right-click</strong> on the timeslot with the person you want to have replaced. A popup window will appear in which you can enter the name of the person you want to replace the first one with. Once you selected the right person, click the <img src="img/icons/refresh.png" alt="icon-refresh" /> <em>Swap</em> button.</p>
      <p>The screenshot below illustrates this procedure. In the first timeslot, SP Shakima Greggs is on break (1). Instead, Madison Handschin, who is on duty on station 3 at that time, should be on break (2, note that there is a slight display bug, that moves the popup window down too far, implying it belongs to a later station.).

      <p>For SPs, you can only choose SPs that have been previously <a href="#sp-selection">assigned to the appropriate roles</a>. If you want to swap an SP with one that does not have the right role assigned, you would have to assign this role first!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you can only select SPs that are currently (at the time, the timeslot you want to change takes place) on break. So, if you for some reason want to swap with another SP, that is currently not on break, you would have to do the swap in two steps.</p>

      <p>The screenshot below shows how it is done. Brent Davis who is in the third rotation (1) should switch places with Alan settle in the first rotation (2). Right click on one of Alan Settles timeslots (it does not matter which one of the ones he is assigned to you take, of course all of them will be swapped out!). Enter Brent Davis' last name and click the <img src="img/icons/refresh.png" alt="icon-refresh" /> <em>Swap</em> button (3).

      <h3><a href="#export-data-to-eosce"><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Export data to eOSCE</a></h3>
      <p>If you want your examiners to use <a href="http://www.e-osce.ch">eOSCE</a> to rate the students on iPads, the checklists and rotations have to be exported, so that the iPads can be prepared for the examiners. There are two ways to do this:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Export the OSCE data directly to your account on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>.</li>
      <li>Download the .osceexchange file and work using the Apple Configurator and the OSCE Editor that comes with <a href="http://www.e-osce.ch">eOSCE</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To use the first way to export the OSCEs base data to iPads, you simply have to enter the S3 bucket name you want to use as well as the access and secret keys that belong to them and then click the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> <em>Save</em> button. Exporting the data then works by choosing the OSCE exams you want to export (e.g. FS2014 3.BA for spring semester 2014, 3rd year of Bachelor) by ticking them and then clicking the <img src="img/icons/extlink.png" alt="icon-extlink" /> <em>Export</em> button.</p>
      <p>You then have your OSCE data on the Amazon S3 cloud computing platform. Now you just have to configure your iPads... (see <a href="#prepare-ipads-for-examiners">Prepare iPads for examiners</a> in the appendix, but skip the steps with importing and saving the file. You just have to enter the S3 credentials in the OSCE Editor so you can simply configure the iPads using the QR-Code).</p>
      <p>On the other hand, we tend to prefer the variant using Apple Configurator. For this, just download the .osceexam file you want by clicking the <em>Download</em> link and then follow the <a href="#prepare-ipads-for-examiners">instruction Prepare iPads for examiners</a>.</p>

The individual performances of students are not scope of the OSCE Managers statistical evaluation tool, though. For the student assessment results, refer to the <a href="http://www.e-osce.ch">eOSCE</a> documentation. Instead you can see how each checklist item performed or how each examiner rated the students.</p>
      <p>There are two tables of data that the OSCE Manager can calculate from the exam results. This is selected in the drop down menu on the top right of the screen. There, you can select either:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>item_analysis</strong>: See the station statistics per checklist item.</li>
      <li><strong>post_analysis</strong>: See the station statistics per examiner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The statistics shown in both cases are quite different. The <em>item_analysis</em> is there to evaluate the quality of the checklist items, whereas the <em>post_analysis</em> determines whether an examiner rated very strictly or was rather lenient.</p>
      <p>Both statistics do first have to be calculated after <a href="#import-test-results-eosce">importing the test results</a>. This is done by pressing the <em>Calculate</em> button just beside the dropdown menu for selecting the statistic you want to display.

      <li><strong>points</strong>: The available choices of points. A checklist item with three possible answers has three different values, e.g. 4/2/0, which means, that the best answer gave 4 points, the worst 0 and the third 2.</li>
      <li><strong>frequency (%)</strong>: The amounts at which the previously mentioned points were awarded.</li>

      <p>As with the item_analysis, the table will be initially collapsed and you will only see the sequences. As soon as you expand the sequences, you will see the stations and when the stations are being expanded, you will see a listing per examiner.</p>
      <p>When you see the statistics per station, you have the possibility to select a checklist item in the dropdown menu that you see on the right. By default, the first item that has the <em>Is Overall Question</em> checkbox checked will be displayed (See <a href="#organizing-questions">4.3.5.3 Organizing questions</a>). At the University of Basel this is usually a question about the general impression a student made.</p>
      <p>The following statistics are available in the post_analysis:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>student count</strong>: Number of students that were assessed in this station / by this examiner.</li>
      <li><strong>pass (new)</strong>: Number of students who passed the station. The value in braces shows the number that additionally passed after adjustment.</li>
      <li><strong>fails (new)</strong>: Number of students who failed the station Value in braces show number of students that additionally failed after adjustment.</li>
      <li><strong>passing grade</strong>: The number of points necessary to achieve per station to pass it.</li>
      <li><strong>average</strong>: The average number of points a student achieved at the station / under this examiner.</li>
      <li><strong>std. deviation</strong>: Standard deviation of the average number of points achieved.</li>
      <li><strong>minimum (sum student)</strong>: The minimum number of points that a student achieved at this station / examiner.</li>
      <li><strong>maximum (sum student)</strong>: The maximum number of points that a student achieved at this station / examiner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You also have the possibility to adjust the number of points that an examiner has given. This is done by clicking the little arrow buttons beside the number boxes for each examiner. This flat out raises or lowers the number of points all the students received from this examiner in the selected checklist item. This is mainly used to compensate for examiners that were determined to have done an assessment that was either far too strict or far too lenient.</p>

      <h3><a href="#cost-accounting"><span class="header-section-number">5.5.3</span> Cost Accounting</a></h3>
      <p>The cost accounting screen is a fairly simple tool that lets you easily determine how many hours an SP/extra worked on a particular OSCE and thus how much he will be paid. The hourly wages used are the ones you entered when <a href="#preparation">creating the semester</a> in which this OSCE took place.</p>
      <p>There are two main functions in this view:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You can export an overview / calculation of all the costs that the SPs caused by clicking the <img src="img/icons/extlink.png" alt="icon-extlink" /> <em>Export</em> button.</li>
      <li>You can export a PDF form for each selected SP by selecting the SPs via the checkboxes besides them and then clicking the <img src="img/icons/print.png" alt="icon-print" /> <em>Print</em> button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The form mentioned above is a work hour form of the University of Basel that can be sent directly to the accounting department to have the SP paid. If you want to have a customised solution, you would either have to manually change the PDF creation in the code or <a href="http://osce-manager.com/services.html">ideally, consult us</a>.</p>

      <p>The system administration menu contains a few features that are not used in every day use of the OSCE Manager for exam preparation, but there is some basic data that you can and have to manage here. Most of the menu items are straight forward data entry features, so they don't need any deeper explanations.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Nationalities</strong>: Register all the nationalities / countries that should be available to be assigned to an SP or examiner.</li>
      <li><strong>Languages</strong>: Register all the languages that are relevant for SPs to be able to speak.</li>
      <li><strong>Professions</strong>: Add / edit / delete professions that SPs are able to select from.</li>
      <li><strong>Document components</strong>: Lets you define the documents that are required to define a role. This gives you the possibility to add a list of either RichText documents or tables where each of these elements has a certain name/function and are assigned to either SPs examiners or the station.</li>
      <li><strong>Import from SCLO</strong>: This lets you import items from the Swiss Catalogue of Learning Objectives and thus lets you standardise your roles. The objectives are available as an Excel-Sheet on <a href="http://sclo.smifk.ch/sclo2008">http://sclo.smifk.ch/sclo2008</a> and this Excel sheet can be directly imported.</li>

      <h3><a href="#prepare-ipads-for-examiners"><span class="header-section-number">8.1.2</span> Prepare iPads for examiners</a></h3>
      <p>This step-by-step instruction explains how you can prepare iPads for examiners by loading them with all the checklists required for an OSCE. It is assumed, that you already exported a <em>*.osceexchange</em> file from OSCE Manager (see <a href="#export-data-to-eosce">Export data to eOSCE</a>) and have this file available. The instruction is split in three. First the checklists have to be exported to the Amazon S3 cloud storage and then the iPads have to be prepared, whereas there are two variants for preparing the iPads.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Instruction: Prepare iPads for examiners</strong></p>
      <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>Open the <em>OSCE-Editor</em> application <img src="img/eosce-exam1.png" alt="OSCE-Editor" /></li>
      <li>Go to <em>File -- Import...</em> and select the file you exported from the OSCE Manager (<em>*.osceexchange</em>).</li>
      <li>Open the <em>Settings</em> view and enter your Amazon S3 credentials. To test whether your credentials are right, you can click on <em>Test Connection</em>. <img src="img/eosce-exam2.png" alt="Amazon S3 credentials" /></li>
      <li>Save the file via <em>File -- Save...</em>.</li>
      <li>Upload the checklists to the Amazon S3 cloud storage by clicking <em>File -- Publish Exam...</em></li>
      <li>You can now choose either of two methods to continue:
      <ul>
      <li>Configure iPads using Amazon S3</li>
      <li>Prepare iPads using Apple Configurator Please don't mix the two methods, as this would lead to problems.</li>

      <li>Drag the <em>OSCE-Eval</em> interface down (towards yourself) until you see the <em>Preferences</em> button. Press this button for a prolonged time.</li>
      <li>The iPads camera will be activated. Use it to photograph the QR-Code in the <em>Settings</em> view of <em>OSCE-Editor</em>. (see the last screenshot of the previous instruction)</li>
      <li>As soon as the QR code gets recognized the iPad is ready for use with the Amazon S3 container.</li>

      <li>Start the <em>Apple Configurator</em>.</li>
      <li>Make sure, that all the iPads you intend to use are supervised and that the OSCE-Eval app will be distributed to all these devices.</li>
      <li>Create a user group for the OSCE.</li>
      <li>In this user group, create a user for each examiner.</li>
