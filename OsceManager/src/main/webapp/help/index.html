    <p><em>The OSCE Manager Manual</em> is a user guide for the <a href="http://www.osce-manager.com" title="OSCE Manager Website">OSCE Manager</a>. It mainly serves as a reference guide that should cover most of the questions that may arise in everyday use of the application. For a general overview and quick introduction to the <em>OSCE Manager</em> we advise you to have a look at the 12 minute <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_yJG9bPF_Q" title="OSCE Manager - An Introduction">introduction video</a>.</p>
    <p>Like the <em>OSCE Manager</em>, the manual is written and maintained by the <a href="http://medizin.unibas.ch">Medical Faculty Of The University of Basel</a> For any inquiries regarding this manual, please write an email to <script type="text/javascript">

    <h1><a href="#introduction-and-overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction and overview</a></h1>
    <p>As has been mentioned in the abstract, we suggest to have a look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_yJG9bPF_Q" title="OSCE Manager - An Introduction">introduction video</a>. It guides you through the process of organising an Objective Structured Clinical Examination step by step and thereby gives you an overview of all the modules of the <em>OSCE Manager</em> and how they roughly interact with each other. This video is the quickest way to delve into the matter.</p>
    <p>This first chapter of the manual will give you a more general overview about what the <em>OSCE Manager</em> consists of. First the rough architecture of the system the software runs on is explained without getting too technical. This may help you to better understand certain features of the software. Furthermore we will explain the basic user interface of the application as well as how the software is divided up in several modules and how they interact.</p>
    <div id="system-architecture" class="section level2">
    <h2><a href="#system-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> System Architecture</a></h2>
    <p>The <em>OSCE Manager</em> as a whole basically consists of two seperate applications, that would usually be running on different servers. The first is the <em>OSCE Manager</em> itself, while the second application is the <em>SP Portal</em>, which is intended to be accessible via the internet, so as to allow simulated patients to fill in their personal details or participate in surveys. In figure 1-1 you see this concept graphically illustrated.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/1-1-system_architecture.png" title="Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture" alt="1-1: Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture." /><p class="caption">1-1: Graphical illustration of OSCE Manager and SP Portal architecture.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The data synchronisation between the two applications is initiated manually by a user of the <em>OSCE Manager</em>. The <em>SP Portal</em> application only stores simulated patient data temporarily, for as long as it is required to be accessible by the SP. Typically both applications are installed on different web servers and therefore are accessed via different URLs, for example the <em>OSCE Manager</em> may be accessible through <em>https://osce-manager.private.myuniversity.edu</em> whereas the <em>SP Portal</em> could be reachable by e.g. entering <em>https://sp-portal.myuniversity.edu</em> in your web-browsers address bar.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Important</em>: Please be aware that the above URLs are only examples! Please ask your system administrator for the URLs that are used at your institution!</p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="user-interface" class="section level2">
    <h2><a href="#user-interface"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> User Interface</a></h2>
    <p>When you start the <em>OSCE Manager</em> you will be confronted with the SP management view. As soon as you click on an entry of the table you will see that the view is roughly divided into four segments. Illustrated in figure 1-2 is said perspective with the four segments, colored in red, green, blue and yellow for ease of explanation.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/1-2-ui.png" title="Overview of user interface" alt="1-2: The main user interface segments of the application, which are colored red, green, blue and yellow in this screen shot." /><p class="caption">1-2: The main user interface segments of the application, which are colored red, green, blue and yellow in this screen shot.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The main components are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Red</strong>: The applications navigation menu where you select the actions you want to perform.</li>
    <li><strong>Green</strong>: In the section to the right of the navigation you often have a table like the one here. There are tools available to filter, navigate and sort the table.</li>
    <li><strong>Blue</strong>: If there is a table in the green area, often there is the possibility to see more details for the objects that are displayed in the table by clicking on them. If this is the case, you will see more details pop up in the blue marked area.</li>
    <li><strong>Yellow</strong>: Throughout the whole application you have the possibility to change the display language as well as the table size. The table size is the number of entries that is usually displayed per page in tables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will mostly only use the left mouse button for clicking. There are very few instances where the right mouse button is used.</p>
    <p><strong>TODO: FFINISH THIS CHAPTER... GONNA DO MORE PRACTICAL STUFF NOW...</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div id="modules" class="section level2">
    <h2><a href="#modules"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Modules</a></h2>
    <p>The <em>OSCE Manager</em> consists of several modules that play together. In the navigation menu of the software you see several boxes that basically make up these modules. In figure 1-3 you see all the elements of said menu.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/1-3-navigation.png" title="Navigation menu of the *OSCE Manager*" alt="1-3: Navigation menu of the OSCE Manager." /><p class="caption">1-3: Navigation menu of the OSCE Manager.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The elements <em>SP</em>, <em>Examiners</em>, <em>Role</em>, <em>OSCE Administration</em> and <em>System Administrations</em> are outlining everything that is possible in this application.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Under <strong>SP</strong>, the simulated patient database can be found. There, you have the possibility to enter SP data, search for SPs, create and edit a custom questionnaire that you want SPs to fill out and you may also define body attributes that SPs may have.</li>
    <li><strong>Examiners</strong> contains the database of examiners, that could participate in OSCEs. It is structured similar to the SP database, but is less sophisticated. In the <em>OSCE Manager</em>, examiners belong to clinics, which are also managed within this module.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Role</strong> menu entry is basically a database of all the roles that could be used or played by an SP during an OSCE, wehereas each role consists of everything required to discribe it such as scripts, checklists, inventory lists, etc. The roles are categorized and these categories are managed within this module as well.</li>
    <li>In <strong>OSCE Administration</strong> you plan, schedule, execute and analyse the OSCE. For each semester in which you want to organize OSCEs you usually go through a step-by-step progress that is mirrored by this menu.</li>
    <li><strong>System Administration</strong> is a collection of things and tools that are not used on a daily basis. These are mainly masks for entering specific data into the database that has not to be regularly used or updated, such as the rooms which could be used for conducting an OSCE within.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Detailed descriptions of the modules can be found in the respective chapters.</p>
    <p>As mentioned in <a href="#system-architecture">chapter 1.1</a>, there is also the <em>SP Portal</em>, which could be considered a module as well, but is actually rather a tool that helps you work with the modules <strong>SP</strong> and <strong>OSCE Administration</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="the-simulated-patient-database" class="section level1">
    <h1><a href="#the-simulated-patient-database"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The simulated patient database</a></h1>
    <p>The simulated patient or SP database is a core part of the OSCE Manager application. Stored within it are all the SPs that did or will participate in an OSCE. This chapter focuses on working with said database and explains what can be done with it. Note, that some functionality is aided by the <em>SP Portal</em> which will be explained in <a href="#the-sp-portal">chapter 6</a>.</p>
    <div id="sp-table-view" class="section level2">
    <h2><a href="#sp-table-view"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> SP table view</a></h2>
    <p>When opening the SP database view by clicking on <em>Simulated patients</em> in the main menu, you will be confronted with a table which contains all the SPs that are stored in the database. The table has some features which you will find throughout the <em>OSCE Manager</em> in other tables.</p>
    <p>In figure 2-1, highlighted in blue, you see the list of SPs that are in the database. When you click on a single entry of this table, you get to see the <a href="#sp-details-view">detailed information about an SP</a> in an area that will scroll into the screen on the right side.</p>
    <p>The number of records you see is governed by the <em>table size</em> setting in the top right, marked in orange. you can use the <em>pager</em> on the right side below the table (highlighted in yellow) to browse to the entries that can not be displayed on the first page. Marked in red, you see the <a href="#quick-search">quick search field and search settings</a> that can be used for simple text search of the database. The green column bar allows you to <a href="#sorting">sort the table</a> and <a href="#sorting">select the columns to display</a>.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/2-1-sp_table.png" alt="2-1: The SP database table with the quick search field (red), column bar (green), the tables contents (blue), the &quot;Add SP&quot;-button (pink), the pager (yellow) and the advanced filters (turquoise)." /><p class="caption">2-1: The SP database table with the quick search field (red), column bar (green), the tables contents (blue), the &quot;Add SP&quot;-button (pink), the pager (yellow) and the advanced filters (turquoise).</p>
    </div>
    <p>If you want to create a new entry in the database you click on the <em>Add SP</em> button <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> (highlighted in pink). This will present you with the <a href="#editing-sp_data">SP editing view</a>. Finally, there are also <a href="#advanced-filters">advanced filtering features</a> that allow you to narrow down the search even more.</p>
    <div id="sorting" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#sorting"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Sorting</a></h3>
    <p>The column controls pictured in figure 2-2 allow you to sort the table by any column available.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/2-2-column-controls.png" alt="2-2: Column controls" /><p class="caption">2-2: Column controls</p>
    </div>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Sorting a table by an arbitrary column</strong></p>
    <p>To sort the table by a certain column:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Click on the name of the column by which you want to sort the data! <img src="img/examples/sorting-1.png" alt="a" /></li>
    <li>You now see, that the table is sorted by first name. This is also indicated by the arrow besides the column name. To reverse the sort order, simply click the same column name again. <img src="img/examples/sorting-2.png" alt="a" /></li>
    <li>As you can see, the sort order has been reversed. <img src="img/examples/sorting-3.png" alt="a" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Additionally, you have the possibility to select the columns which you want to display in the table.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Selecting the displayed columns</strong></p>
    <p>To display additional columns:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Click on the arrow button on the right side of a column. <img src="img/examples/columns-1.png" alt="Screenshot depicting &#39;Click on the arrow button on the right side of a column.&#39;" /></li>
    <li>You now see a list of all columns that are available for display. <img src="img/examples/columns-2.png" alt="Screenshot depicting &#39;all columns that are available for sorting.&#39;" /></li>
    <li>In this list, click on the checkbox besides the column names to activate or deactivate the columns you want to show / hide in the table. <img src="img/examples/columns-3.png" alt="Screenshot depicting &#39;click on the checkbox besides the column names to activate or deactivate the columns&#39;" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div id="quick-search" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#quick-search"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Quick search</a></h3>
    <p>The quick search window on the top left of the SP table allows you to search for any text within the SP records. As soon as you enter any text in the search field, the table will be filtered and only SPs that match your search will be shown.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Searching for an SP by name</strong></p>
    <p>To search for an SP by name, e.g. you search for Mr. <em>Henry Jones</em>.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Click the search box on the top left of the screen. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-1.png" alt="Click the search box" /></li>
    <li>Enter their name, e.g. <em>Henry</em> and you will see the results almost immediately. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-2.png" alt="Enter the name of the person you want to search" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Besides searching for SPs by name you can also search by other attributes.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: General use of quick search</strong></p>
    <p>To search for an SP by city, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Move the cursor over the wrench symbol to the right of the search box <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-3.png" alt="Move the cursor over the wrench symbol" /></li>
    <li>Click the columns in which you want to search, e.g. <em>City</em>. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-4.png" alt="Click the columns in which you want to search" /></li>
    <li>Enter the search term you want to search by, e.g. the name of the city. As in the previous example you will see the results almost immediately. <img src="img/examples/quicksearch-5.png" alt="Enter the search term" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As you could see in the two examples you can search the following columns via the quick search box: <em>Name</em>, <em>First Name</em>, <em>Postal code</em>, <em>City</em>, <em>Street</em>, <em>Telephone</em>, <em>Telephone 2</em>, <em>Mobile</em>, <em>Email</em>, <em>Bank</em>, <em>BIC</em>, <em>IBAN</em>, <em>Comment</em>.</p>
    <p>A click on the arrow symbol <img src="img/icons/arrowrefresh-1-w.png" alt="refresh arrow icon" /> executes the search once again.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div id="advanced-filters" class="section level2">
    <h2><a href="#advanced-filters"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Advanced filters</a></h2>
    <p>Since there are many non-textual fields that characterise an SP in the database, more sophisticated search methods are available. With the advanced filters that can be found below the SP table, it is possible to filter the table by numeric ranges, gender, profession or even custom information defined in the <a href="#the-questionnaire">questionnaire</a>.</p>
    <p>This filter functionality can be found in the <a href="#role-management">role management chapter</a> again. There, the exact same filters can be used to define which criteria a simulated patient must fulfill to be suited for a certain role.</p>
    <p>To filter the table with one of the advanced filters, click on one of the available filter buttons shown in figure 2-4.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/2-4-advanced_filters.png" alt="2-4: The advanced filters, available for searching SPs" /><p class="caption">2-4: The advanced filters, available for searching SPs</p>
    </div>
    <p>After you click on one of the buttons a dialog window comes up. For example, if you click on the <em>numeric filter</em> button <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />, a dialog like the one shown in figure 2-5 appears.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/2-5-numeric_filter.png" alt="2-5: The numeric filter box with the linkage field, parameter field, comparison field and the value field." /><p class="caption">2-5: The numeric filter box with the linkage field, parameter field, comparison field and the value field.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Most of the filters and filter options are rather straight forward and don't need a lot of explanation. The ones that do are treated in the following three chapters.</p>
    <div id="linkage" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#linkage"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Linkage</a></h3>
    <p>The leftmost dropdown menu from figure 2-5 is the same for all of the filter boxes. It contains the linkage operation which defines how the filter is applied in conjunction with the preceding filter. The two possible values are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>OR</strong>: means that an SP has to match with either the preceding filter <em>or</em> the filter that is getting the <em>OR</em>-linkage attribute.</li>
    <li><strong>AND</strong>: defines that the criteria of this current filter <em>and</em> the criteria of the previous filter have to apply <em>both</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note, that the order of criteria is relevant for the linkage-attribute. The linkage setting of the first-defined filter is irrelevant, but the last criterion is always the strongest.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Using multiple search filters</strong></p>
    <p>You want to search for female SPs that are either more than 60 years old or younger than 30 years old. Thus, you'd follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Click on the <em>gender</em> button <img src="img/icons/person.png" alt="person icon" />. In the menu that appears you select the gender to be <em>female</em>. <img src="img/examples/2-1-gender.png" alt="Adding a filter by gender" /></li>
    <li>Now you select women who are younger than 30. To do that you click on the <em>numeric filter</em> button <img src="img/icons/wrench.png" alt="wrench icon" />, select the <em>smaller than</em> sign (<em>&lt;</em>) and enter the number 30. <img src="img/examples/2-2-age30.png" alt="Adding a filter by age" /></li>
    <li>Finally, you do the same as in item two, but now you select the <em>larger than</em> sign (<em>&gt;</em>), enter the number 60 and select the <em>linkage</em> to be of type <em>OR</em>. <img src="img/examples/2-3-age60.png" alt="Adding a filter by age" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have a look at the result now, you will notice that there are male SPs in the result. This is because the last criterion is linked with <em>OR</em>-Linkage, which basically makes this selection to be: <em>Show all SPs who are female and younger than 30 years old, or show all SPs who are older than 60 years old</em>.</p>
    <p>Instead we wanted a selection which shows <em>all SPs who are younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years old and are female</em>. To achieve this now, we continue:</p>
    <ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>In the criteria table that appeared, click on the trash symbol <img src="img/icons/trash.png" alt="trash icon" /> besides the filter where you filtered by gender. <img src="img/examples/2-4-remove_filter.png" alt="Removing a filter" /></li>
    <li>Now we add the same filter again at the end of the list, as described in item 1. (Click on the <em>gender</em> button. In the menu that appears you select the gender to be <em>female</em>.) <img src="img/examples/2-1-gender.png" alt="Adding the filter by gender to the end of the filter list" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you see the results you actually wanted.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/examples/2-5-results.png" alt="The SP database, showing only SPs who are female and either younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years." /><p class="caption">The SP database, showing only SPs who are female and either younger than 30 years old or older than 60 years.</p>

    </div>
    <div id="comparisons" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#comparisons"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Comparisons</a></h3>
    <p>Most filters have a comparison operation, where in the simplest case you can just select whether an SP should have a certain attribute or not. For example when using the <em>Profession</em>-filter, you can select if the SP should have a certain profession, but it is also possible to select that he must not have a certain profession.</p>
    <p>The <em>numeric filter</em> allows for mathematical comparisons such as <em>equal</em> (=), <em>not equal</em> (≠), <em>greater than</em> (&gt;) and <em>less than</em> (&lt;). Similarly the <em>Languages</em> filter allows the same comparisons to language skill levels.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="attribute-and-questionnaire-filters" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#attribute-and-questionnaire-filters"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Attribute and Questionnaire filters</a></h3>
    <p>Whereas most of the filters are rather straight forward to use, the <em>Attributes</em> and <em>Questionnaire</em> filters are special. The <em>Attributes</em> filter, shown in figure 2-6, is used to search for user definable attributes (see chapter <a href="#define-and-use-attributes">Define and use attributes</a>). It is easy to use, as it only shows a simple drop-down menu from which you can select all of the available attributes.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/2-6-attributes_filter.png" alt="2-6: The attributes filter popup. The drop-down menu shows all the attributes that are available for selection." /><p class="caption">2-6: The attributes filter popup. The drop-down menu shows all the attributes that are available for selection.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The more interesting filter is the <em>Questionnaire</em> filter. In it, the <a href="#the-questionnaire">questionnaire</a> can be searched. This is a collection of user definable questions, that each SP can answer. For more information on how to use the questionnaire, plese see <a href="#the-questionnaire">the chapter in question</a>. With this filter it is possible to efficiently search this questionnaire. When you first click the <em>Questionnaire</em> filter button, you are confronted with a text field into which you can type a keyword to help find the question (see figure 2-7). As soon as you enter something into this textbox, a menu with matching questions appears.</p>
    <div class="figure">

    </div>
    <p>After selecting a question, you can define what answer you are looking for. Depending on the type of the question, either a drop-down menu appears (see figure 2-8) for multiple choice or yes/no-questions, in which you can select the answer you are looking for, or in case of an open question answered with written text, you can enter text in a textbox (see figure 2-9).</p>

    <p><strong>Example: Searching SPs by questionnaire items</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Important</strong>: <em>Note, that you have to have these questions defined in the questionnaire before this example works. See chapter <a href="#the-questionnaire">The questionnaire</a>.</em></p>
    <p>You want to list all the SPs that wear glasses and are motivated by money. This means that the questionnaire has to have some questions defined, which cover these two points. In our example the two following questions are predefined:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Do you wear glasses?</li>
    <li>What motivated you to participate in our simulation patient program?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first of the above questions is a Yes/No question, while the latter is an open question.</p>

    <h3><a href="#editing-sp-data"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Editing SP data</a></h3>
    <p>There are several types of data that can be edited. Let's concentrate on the SPs basic data first. The following example shows you how to change SP details. When you click on <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> <em>Add SP</em> below the <a href="#sp-table-view">SP table view</a> or if you click on <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> <em>Edit</em> in the controls panel in the top right of the screen, the same mask will show. So the procedure for editing SP data or adding a new SP is basically the same.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Adding a new SP or Editing SP basic data</strong></p>
    <p>We want to edit some basic attributes of the simulated patient <em>Isaac Hausner</em>. After we selected him in the <a href="#sp-table-view">SP table view</a> by clicking on his name, we can edit his data by following these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Click on <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="pencil icon" /> <em>Edit</em> in the controls panel in the top right of the screen. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-1.png" alt="Click on Edit" /></li>
    <li>In the upcoming screen you can edit the name and contact data of the SP. For example you can change his email address. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-2.png" alt="Editing the mail address" /></li>
    <li>If you click on the tab <em>particulars</em>, you're able to edit additional information, such as birth date, height, weight, marital status etc. We can e.g. change his profession by clicking on the profession suggest box and clicking or typing a new profession. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-3.png" alt="Select a new profession" /></li>
    <li>Editing bank account information works the same way. You can enter account number and bank address information in the entry mask. The country dropdown is the same type of dropdown menu as the <em>profession</em> and <em>nationality</em> boxes found in the <em>Particulars</em> tab. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-4.png" alt="Changing bank account information" /></li>
    <li>You may also add comments with custom formatting to each SP. These comments can also be searched using the <a href="#quick-search">quick search</a> and can therefore be used to add custom information. The formatting options are a subset of those found in regular word processing software. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-5.png" alt="Adding comments" /></li>
    <li>After you have done your changes, click on <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="disk icon" /> <em>Save</em> on the top right of the control panel. If you decided to throw away your changes, you can also click on <img src="img/icons/closethick.png" alt="close icon" /> <em>Cancel</em>. <img src="img/examples/edit-sp-6.png" alt="Saving your changes" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Additionally, there are some attributes that have to be edited by other means. These would be the <em>Language skill</em>, the <a href="#define-and-use-attributes">attributes</a> and <a href="#answering-questions">the questionnaire</a>. The latter two are treated in their own chapters.</p>
    <p>You may want to have certain SPs who are able to communicate in certain languages. The language skills tab allows you to specifically define which languages a simulated patient is able to speak on what level.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Editing language skills</strong></p>
    <p>You want to add language skills to a certain SP.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>Go to the <em>Language skills</em> tab in the <a href="#sp-details-view">SP details view</a>. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-1.png" alt="Select the language skills tab" /></li>
    <li>Select one of the pre-defined languages from the language drop down. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-2.png" alt="Select a language" /></li>
    <li>Select the skill level at which the SP is speaking this language. <img src="img/examples/langSkill-3.png" alt="Select the language skill level" /></li>
    <li>Click on <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="plus icon" /> <em>Add language skill</em> <img src="img/examples/langSkill-4.png" alt="Click on Add language skill" /></li>

    <div id="status-deletion-and-synchronisation" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#status-deletion-and-synchronisation"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Status, deletion and synchronisation</a></h3>
    <p>In the SP database, each SP has a status. There are several statuses an SP can be in and these all have different implications which mainly show in the possible actions of the control panel. In the following list, the implications of each status is described.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Active</strong>: This is the default status and means, that the SP is available for OSCEs and can be modified in any way you like.</li>
    <li><strong>Inactive</strong>: An SP can be excluded from participating in future OSCEs by deactivating the SP. This means, that he cannot be selected in any new OSCEs and his data can not be exported to the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a></li>
    <li><strong>Anonymized</strong>: After an SP has decided that he does not want to take part in any OSCEs anymore but he has been in OSCEs in the past, the SP can be anonyized. This means that any personal data of the SP gets erased.</li>
    <li><strong>Exported</strong>: This status indicates, that the SPs personal data is currently accessible through the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a> and to prevent inconsistencies the SPs data can not be edited.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now a few examples follow to help you with actions that are relevant to the statuses.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Deleting / anonymizing an SP</strong></p>
    <p>To delete an SP, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>After you selected the SP to delete from the table, click on the <a href="img/icons/trash.png">trash icon</a> <em>Delete</em> button on the right side of the SP controls panel. <img src="img/examples/delete-sp-1.png" alt="Click the delete button" /></li>
    <li>You will be presented with a pop-up that asks you for confirmation. In this pop-up, click &quot;OK&quot;. <img src="img/examples/delete-sp-2.png" alt="Confirm delete" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the SP has already been assigned to a role in an OSCE in the past, the SP cannot be physically deleted from the database. Instead, all SP data will be <em>anonymized</em> (replaced with <em>xxx</em>).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Deactivating and reactivating an SP</strong></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>If an SP should be deactivated, click on the <img src="img/icons/closethick.png" alt="close icon" /> <em>Deactivate</em> button. Note that this is only possible if the SP is not currently in the <strong>Exported</strong> status! <img src="img/examples/deactivate-sp-1.png" alt="Deactivate SP" /></li>
    <li>After the SP has been deactivated, you can choose to reactivate the SP again by clicking on the <img src="img/icons/check.png" alt="check icon" /> <em>Activate</em> button to reactivate the SP. <img src="img/examples/deactivate-sp-3.png" alt="Reactivating the SP" /></li>
    </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Example: Synchronize SP data with the SP Portal</strong></p>
    <p>If you want to synchronize an SPs personal data with the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a>, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>After you've made sure that the SP is in an active state, click the <img src="img/icons/extlink.png" alt="extlink icon" /> <em>Sent To DMZ</em> button. This sends the SP data to the DMZ (<em>Demilitarized Zone</em> - in this case a server that is accessible publicly over the internet) so it can be accessed via the <a href="#the-sp-portal">SP Portal</a> <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-1.png" alt="Send to DMZ" /></li>
    <li>if the export was successful, you will be notified. <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-2.png" alt="Send to DMZ successful!" /></li>
    <li>Now the SP can log in to the SP Portal and edit his data (<a href="#the-sp-portal">see chapter 6</a>)</li>
    <li>After the SP has come through and updated his details on the SP Portal, you can reimport the data by clicking on <img src="img/icons/arrowthickstop-1-s.png" alt="arrow icon" /> <em>Pull From DMZ</em> to reimport the data. <img src="img/examples/sp-sync-3.png" alt="Pull From DMZ" /></li>

    <p>For SPs it is often desirable to exclude certain body parts from examination, e.g. if they are scarred somewhere or just don't feel comfortable with it. Defining such attributes could later on help in assigning suited SPs to roles.</p>
    <p>There are three different types of <em>attributes</em>: <em>scar</em>, <em>tattoo</em> and <em>Do not examine</em>. Use them where appropriate - <em>scar</em> if you define a scar, <em>tattoo</em> if you define a tattoo and <em>Do not examine</em> if there is some other reason a certain body part should not be examined.</p>
    <p>All the attributes can be found when you click on <em>Attributes</em> in the <em>SP</em>-section of the <em>OSCE Managers</em> navigation. You will be presented with a table showing all the predefined attributes and the option to add new attributes.</p>

    <p>In this part of the OSCE Manager application you can manage roles. Roles <em>encompass everything that is tied to one station in an OSCE where one particular skill is tested and usually an SP plays the role</em>. All the roles that will be resorted back to during an OSCE have to be <em>previously</em> defined here. If you want to change an aspect of a role, such as the SPs script, you usually just edit the role and don't create a new role just foor that.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>A quick sidenote about terminology: The <em>role</em> basically describes every aspect of what will be called a <em>station</em> during an OSCE. Since the role is universal (i.e. it has nothing to do with a specific room or OSCE), we do not call it a station. The term <em>station</em> will be used when organising an OSCE and assigning a <em>role</em> to a room.</p>

    <p>Roles are grouped into disciplines and skills. Each role tests one particular skill, which in turn belongs to a certain discipline. For example there may be a discipline <em>Ophthalmology</em> within which there are several skills that you may want to test, e.g. <em>Ocular Tonometry</em> and <em>Ophtalmoscopy</em>.</p>
    <p>Through this categorisation of roles it is easier to find the right roles when you start organising an OSCE.</p>

    <li>The <strong>basic controls</strong> on the title bar, to the right of the roles full name, contains some basic actions that apply to the role as a whole, such as <strong>viewing previous versions</strong> of the role, <strong>editing</strong> the basic information of the role, <strong>copying the role</strong>, <strong>printing the role</strong> or even <strong>deleting</strong> the role.</li>
    <li>The <strong>details tabs</strong> group all the information into appropriate categories:

    <ul>
    <li><p>In the <a href="#role-table-view">role table</a>, you click on a skill to which you want to add a new role. If there are no roles present yet, you will be immediately presented with the mask where you have to fill in the roles' basic information.</p></li>

    </div>
    <p>The mask that you see contains the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Acronym</strong>: This is an abbreviation or a <strong>short hand name for a role</strong>. It will be displayed anywhere where a short hand name is more convenient. Please choose a name that makes it clear what role is meant.</li>
    <li><strong>Role designation</strong>: This is the full and descriptive name of the role. This will be used whenever there is enough space available to display the full name of the role.</li>
    <li><strong>Role type</strong>: There are three possibilites for this option:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>SimPat</strong>: designates a regular role, where a simulated patient has to be examined by the student.</li>
    <li><strong>Supernumerary</strong>: a role where someone has to play a role which doesn't involve being examined.</li>
    <li><strong>Material</strong>: a role where only some equipment is required, but no one has to play any role.</li>
    </ul>
    Note, that the distinction between <em>SimPat</em> and <em>Supernumerary</em> mainly exists for cost calculation reasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Academic Year</strong>: This allows you once again to define in which academic year a role is to be tested in the OSCE.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill</strong>: This allows you to change the skill to which the role belongs.</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute number of backup-SPs</strong>: This is the absolute minimum number of SPs that would be on backup for this station during an OSCE.</li>
    <li><strong>Proportion of backup-SPs vs. no. of circuis</strong>: The number of SPs that are on backup per circuit for this role. I.e. if this role is used on four circuits in parallel at an OSCE, the stated number of SPs times 4 have to be there as backups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you go to the checklist tab, you'll see only one field where you can give a designation to the checklist of this role.</p>

    <p>You can also <strong>copy</strong> a role. To do this, simply click on the <img src="img/icons/copy.png" alt="icon-copy" /> <em>Copy</em> button in the control bar on the top right side. This creates a copy of the current role.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Important</em>: Be aware that as of the time of writing this manual, checklists and scripts are not copied; that means that a copy of a role references the same checklist and script as the original, and changes to either of those will be seen from both roles.</p>

    <div id="roles-and-versions" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#roles-and-versions"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Roles and versions</a></h3>
    <p>Over time you may want to change a role. Maybe you've had a role that you had in an OSCE for two consecutive years, but now you want to change some parts of it to not let the students' information exchange ruin the novelty of the role. Thus you decide to change some symptoms and therefore the SPs role and the checklist have to be changed. Now the OSCEs that were held in the past still used the role with the old checklist and script, and you want to keep it that way. Now what to do?</p>
    <p>Luckily, the roles have versions. If you go to the <a href="#creating-copying-or-editing-a-role">editing screen</a> and click on the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> <em>Save</em> button you will be presented with the following dialog:</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/major-minor.png" alt="Selection between major changes or minor changes" /><p class="caption">Selection between major changes or minor changes</p>
    </div>
    <p>You can select between:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Major changes</strong>: This is what you would want to do in the above scenario. This effectively creates a copy of the role as it was and archives it.</li>
    <li><strong>Minor changes</strong>: If you don't need to access an old version and just did some small changes, you select minor changes. This just overwrites the current version of the role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everytime you make a change <strong>that triggers the appearence of the version dialog</strong>, and you select either <em>Minor</em> or <em>Major changes</em>, the version number of the role gets updated. In case of a major change, the number before the dot gets bumped and the number after the dot gets reset to zero (e.g. from 1.2 to 2.0). In case of a minor change, the number behind the dot is increased by one.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p><em>Important</em>: Note, that this dialog only appears when you either save changes, that you made in the <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> <a href="#creating-copying-or-editing-a-role"><em>Edit</em> screen of the role</a> or when you save changes you made to the <a href="#role-scripts">role scripts</a>. If you change any other aspect of the role, even the <a href="#checklist">checklist</a>, you will not be asked about a version change. Thus, if you know you're going to make significant changes to a role, you have to take care of correct versioning yourself!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since the role gets archived when you do <em>major changes</em> to it, you can still access old versions of the role if you want to by clicking the <img src="img/icons/rwd.png" alt="icon-rwd" /> <em>Previous version</em> button in the main control bar. If you are currently looking at an older version of a role you will notice this by the fact that you can't make any changes. To access future versions, click on the appropriate <img src="img/icons/fwd.png" alt="icon-fwd" /> <em>Next version</em> or <img src="img/icons/end.png" alt="icon-end" /> <em>Current version</em> buttons.</p>

    <h3><a href="#checklist"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Checklist</a></h3>
    <p>This is one of the core aspects of the role. This is the checklist that the examiners will fill out to evaluate the students during the OSCE. There is the possibility to print the checklist, so it can be filled out in paper form, or you can also <a href="#export-data-to-eosce">export the checklist</a> to <a href="http://www.e-osce.ch/">eOSCE</a>, an iPad application, that allows the examiners to fill out the checklists on a tablet computer.</p>
    <p>In the screenshot below, you'll see a view of the checklist in a role about <em>Loss of consciousness</em> with colored annotations. You can see, that the checklist is divided into several sections that group questions or items, that belong together.</p>

    <li><strong>Name</strong>: Each checklist has a name that is displayed in the tab bar. See <a href="l#creating-editing-or-copying-a-role">creating, editing or copying a role</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Section</strong>: As mentioned above, the checklist is divided into sections. Each section consists of a section title, a description and contains questions. They can be ordered arbitrarily. Sections can be imported from other roles.</li>
    <li><strong>Question</strong>: Each question (or checklist item) belongs to a section and consists of a question text, an instruction text and an option that marks the question as a question to mark a general impression. Furthermore, there are <em>options</em> and <em>criteria</em> belonging to each question.</li>
    <li><strong>Options</strong>: Options are the possible options an examiner has to answer the question. Usually the options are ratings of the students performance in the topic covered by the corresponding checklist item.</li>
    <li><strong>Criteria</strong>: These are a list of items that help the examiner assess which option to choose. Usually these are actions a student has to take to in order to fulfill a criterion.</li>

    <h3><a href="#cards"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.8</span> Cards</a></h3>
    <p>The term <em>cards</em> stems from the fact that for certain roles in OSCEs, cards were used to convey additional information to the student that could not have been given any other, such as e.g. how the eye would actually look if the SP would actually have some kind of disease. In that case the card would simply show a photograph of an eye that shows the desired symptoms.</p>

    <div id="role-scripts" class="section level3">
    <h3><a href="#role-scripts"><span class="header-section-number">4.3.9</span> Role scripts</a></h3>
    <p>This section allows you to create role-specific rich text documents or tables, that can be printed along with everything else from the role. This functionality is mainly used to add scripts for SPs, task descriptions and possible additional documents, such as maybe additional instructions for the examiner.</p>
    <p>When you click on the <em>Role scripts</em> tab of a role, that does not have any role scripts assigned yet, you have to choose what kind of documents this role requires. This is done by selecting a template of <em>document components</em>. These document components describe <em>who needs what document</em>. See the <a href="#document-components">chapter on document components</a> for additional information. In this manual I work with components I named &quot;Default Role Documents&quot;, that consist of a task description, a script for the SP and additional instructions for the examiner.</p>
    <p><em>Note, that these document components first have to be defined in the menu item <a href="#document-components">Document components</a>. If there are none defined yet, in order to create role scripts you have to define the components first!</em></p>
    <p>To get started, select the document components you desire for this station in the dropdown suggestive search box and click the <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="icon-plus" /> <em>Select document components</em> button.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/role-scripts-1.png" alt="Selecting document components." /><p class="caption">Selecting document components.</p>
    </div>
    <p>You will be presented with an overview of the documents that are contained within the selected component. In the following screenshot you will see this view with colored annotations.</p>
    <div class="figure">
    <img src="img/role-scripts-2.png" alt="Role scripts view with empty role scripts" /><p class="caption">Role scripts view with empty role scripts</p>
    </div>
    <p>What you see in this perspective are several things. All the documents that are contained within the selected document component can be seen. Each of these documents does have:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A <strong>title / description</strong>. This should tell you what this document should contain. In the example above we have e.g. &quot;Task description&quot; which is a pretty obvious hint.</li>
    <li>A <em>box containing the</em> <strong>intended audience</strong> of this document. This can be used when printing the role, to only print what you actually need. Maybe you have trainings for simulated patients for which you already need the scripts for the SPs. Then you only print the documents that are designated with &quot;SP&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These last two items have to be predefined in the document components. The only thing you can actually do here is:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Change the document components</strong> that this role uses by selecting another document component template from the dropdown menu on the bottom of the screen and clicking <img src="img/icons/plus.png" alt="icon-plus" /> <em>Select document components</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit the actual documents</strong> by clicking the Edit button <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> for the appropriate document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you <strong>edit a document</strong> by clicking the <img src="img/icons/pencil.png" alt="icon-pencil" /> edit button, you will see a rich-text editor such as the one you already saw in the <a href="#editing-sp-data">edit SP view</a>. It's feature-set is just a limited set of the ones found in general word processing software. After you're done editing the document, click on the <img src="img/icons/disk.png" alt="icon-disk" /> save button to save your changes. You will be asked whether this is a minor or major change to the role (see <a href="#roles-and-versions">Roles and versions</a> for explanation).</p>
